[ARCHIVED] edx ORA (Open Response Assessor)
===========================================

The ORA will take a submission from an xqueue installation, pass it through machine learning grading, peer grading, and staff grading as appropriate, and return a result to LMS.  This is to be used with the edx-platform and xqueue.  It allows for the assessment of open response problems on the edx platform.
